OOPs

Class: Class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of class. It is like a blueprint for an object.

Object: Object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, memory is not allocated, but when an object is created, memory is allocated.

Data abstraction: Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information out the data to the outside world, and hiding the background details or implemenntation.

Encapsulation: Wrapping up of the data under a single unit. The variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.

Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and charcteristics from another class.

Polymorphism: we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form
